Recently, researchers have developed object detection methods in huge progress [1,9,11,22,23,26,32]. While the
industry pursues high-performance object detection methods with real-time constraints, researchers focus on designing one-stage detectors [1,21â€“23,25] with efficient network
architectures [4,15,16,28,29] and advanced training stages [10, 16, 20, 25, 30].
